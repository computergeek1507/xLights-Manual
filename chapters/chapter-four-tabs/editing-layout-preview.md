{% hint style="info" %}
When would you create an additional Preview layout?  If you had a corner block and you wanted to sequence from 2 directions or if you have a really wide block you can split it so everything does not become small, or if you are sequencing multiple houses in your street.
{% endhint %}

Enter the name for the Preview Layout and click Ok.

The image size has to be the same as the default image and as such, it is not available to change. Click on the Save button to save it.

The preview window can now be used to create Models or Model Groups against similar to the Default Preview layout. Models can be reassigned to the different Preview by changing the "Preview" Model Setting.

When a Preview is Deleted, All the Models currently assigned to it will become unassigned and need to be reassigned to another preview.
