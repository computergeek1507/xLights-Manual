This model is used to represent window frames and door outlines. The \# Lights Top is the number of light across the top of the window frame. The \# Lights Left/Right is the number of lights per side. xLight will assume the sides are the same length and use this number for both sides. The \# Lights Bottom is the number of light across the bottom. This can be set to zero for Door Frames. Direction specified the wiring direction. Starting Location is the location of the first node.

Double check the node layout and wiring view to verify your Window Frame definition matches your model. Depending on number of lights per side and the Direction/Starting Location the wiring can change.
