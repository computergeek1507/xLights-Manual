### **Icicles Model**

The \# of Strings would normally be 1.  

The Lights per String represents the physical number of light nodes, bulbs or pixels.

You can drag the green or top blue pixel to hang the icicles at an angle and then drag the lower blue pixel to cause the drop to sheer and hand vertically shear.

The drop pattern indicates how the pixels are arranged on each drop and how many.

So, if the total lights on the string is 80 and the drop pattern is  3,4,5,4, this indicates that the first drop has 3 nodes, the next 4 , then 5 then 4.

This pattern is then repeated until 80 nodes have been accounted for.
