Adjust the width, height and brightness attributes to your preference. The width and height depends on your screen size and resolution.  If unsure, start with a .jpg or .bmp image with a resolution of around 1100 \* 500 and adjust the width and height for the best fit. The ‘fill’ attribute will scale the image to best fit your window.  Click on the Save button to save the Layout settings.
