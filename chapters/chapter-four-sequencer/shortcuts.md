## Shortcuts

There are a number of shortcut keys that can be used for functionality or adding effects on the grid. These effects are stored in the xlights\_keybindings.xml file and can be modified by the user.  Note that you must edit this file while xLights is NOT running.  Changes will be lost when xLights closes as this file is saved upon exit each time.
