If you double Click on the  Model Group name, it will expand and show you the models that have been defined as part of the Model group - in this case the ‘Arch 1’ model. Double Click again to collapse the Model Group.

Select an effect \(in this case the Bars effect\) and drag it onto the grid in line with the ‘Arch 1’ model.

This is effectively placing the effect against the model.  

You could also place it against the Model Group - \(one line higher\), in which case it applies to all models under the Group.

You can grab the edge \(in purple\) and drag it to the right to stretch.  Note that the effect shows in the Model window and in the House Preview window.

You can change attributes via the Effects Setup Window.  For example, change from ‘Rainbow’ to ‘Palette’. This window can be dragged out to a another location and expanded. The windows will resize.

You can change the color of the effect, by selecting a different set of colors from the Color window.

Use the highlighted keys to start, stop pause, rewind and play again.  As the sequence plays, you can see the effects on the House Preview screen.
