# Model Group Definition

## Model Group Definition

The next step is to define a Model Group. You can work without using model groups. You can also do this at any time later, but it is good practice and most useful later to have each model part of a group.

Right Click in the Models Group panel. An ‘Add Group’ button will be displayed.

Click on the Add Group button. Enter a Model Group Name when prompted. I have called it ‘All Models Group‘. Every time I add a model, I will add it to this Model Group. A model can be part of more than one model group.

Next add the models that are part of the Model Group to the group. From the list of models, select the model and click on the right arrow to add to the model group window.

The model ‘Arch1’ is now part of the ‘All Models Group’ group. Click on Save when complete.

Repeat the above steps and add a second Model Group ‘Arches Group’. Click on OK and then click on Save.

Select the Model group ‘Arches Group’ and adding the model ‘Arch1’ to that group too.

Click on Save to save the Model group updates \(and all changes to the layout, models or model groups since the last time this save button was clicked on\).

Click on Save to save the Model group updates \(and all changes to the layout, models or model groups since the last time this save button was clicked on\).

This completes a definition of a single model ‘Arch1’ that is an ‘Arches’ type of model, is part of a Model Groups ‘All Models’ and ‘Arches Group’, that is to be displayed on the Layout display. The model image has been resized and placed against the fence in the layout.

Should you wish to Rename a Model group or delete it, highlight the Model group Name and right click. Use the resulting window to rename or delete the group.

You can also add additional groups. The next step is to create a new sequence.
