# Adding Models to a View

## Adding Models to a View

{% hint style="info" %}
All Model are added to the Master View by default, when creating a New Sequence, this section can be skipped unless you are adding new models to an existing sequence.
{% endhint %}

Models added to the layout after a sequence was created must be added to a View so that the models are then available to place effects against. Each sequence has a ‘Master View’ that is automatically created. The Master View defines a list of models that are specific to that sequence only. For this example, we will use the Master View.

{% hint style="success" %}
It is worthwhile creating another View that contains all your models \(or a common set of models\) which can then be used in all your sequences so that they do not have to be added each time.
{% endhint %}

Right click on the Timing grid names \(in the area highlighted on the screen\).
