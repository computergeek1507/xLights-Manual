# Adding Models to a View

## Adding Models to a View

{% hint style="info" %}
All Model are added to the Master View by default, when creating a New Sequence, this section can be skipped unless you are adding new models to an existing sequence.
{% endhint %}

If you not already on the Sequencer tab, then click on the Sequencer tab. The timing mark grids that you have created will be displayed on the left side of the sequencer canvas.

Ensure that the ‘Beats’ timing grid is selected. Use the zoom buttons to zoom out or in.

The next step is to add the required models to a View so that the models are then available to place effects against.  Each sequence has a ‘Master View’ that is automatically created. The Master View defines a list of models that are specific to that sequence only. For this example, we will use the Master View.

{% hint style="success" %}
It is worthwhile creating another View that contains all your models \(or a common set of models\) which can then be used in all your sequences so that they do not have to be added each time.
{% endhint %}

Right click on the Timing grid names \(in the area highlighted on the screen\).
