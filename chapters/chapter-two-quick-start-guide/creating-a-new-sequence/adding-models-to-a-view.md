# Adding Models to a View

## Adding Models to a View

{% hint style="info" %}
All Model are added to the Master View by default, when creating a New Sequence, this section can be skipped unless you are adding new models to an existing sequence.
{% endhint %}

If you not already on the Sequencer tab, then click on the Sequencer tab. The timing mark grids that you have created will be displayed on the left side of the sequencer canvas.

Ensure that the ‘Beats’ timing grid is selected. Use the zoom buttons to zoom out or in.

The next step is to add the required models to a View so that the models are then available to place effects against.  Each sequence has a ‘Master View’ that is automatically created. The Master View defines a list of models that are specific to that sequence only. For this example, we will use the Master View.

{% hint style="success" %}
It is worthwhile creating another View that contains all your models \(or a common set of models\) which can then be used in all your sequences so that they do not have to be added each time.
{% endhint %}

Right click on the Timing grid names \(in the area highlighted on the screen\).

Select the Edit Display Elements option from the pop up window.

Select the Master View from the top window.

From the Left window select the items you would like to add and Click the Right Arrow Button. If you select the Double Right Arrow all the items \(All Models, Arch1, and Arches Group\) will be added.

Click on Close when done.

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating a new sequence by default all model in the Master View will be added to the Sequencer.
{% endhint %}

Back on the Sequencer tab, select Master View as the view to be used if this is not defaulted in.

The ‘Beats’ timing mark , the ‘All Models’ and the ‘Arches Group’ model groups \(which were defined as part of the Master View in the previous two steps\) are then displayed.

Model groups are identified by a small group icon after the name.

If you double Click on the  Model Group name, it will expand and show you the models that have been defined as part of the Model group - in this case the ‘Arch 1’ model.

You can then drop and effect against either the Model Group or the Model.  Double Click again to collapse the Model Group.

Adding Effects Against a Model

Select an effect \(in this case the Bars effect\) and drag it onto the grid in line with the ‘Arch 1’ model.

This is effectively placing the effect against the model.  

You could also place it against the Model Group - \(one line higher\), in which case it applies to all models under the Group.

You can grab the edge \(in purple\) and drag it to the right to stretch.  Note that the effect shows in the Model window and in the House Preview window.

You can change attributes via the Effects Setup Window.  For example, change from ‘Rainbow’ to ‘Palette’. This window can be dragged out to a another location and expanded. The windows will resize.

You can change the color of the effect, by selecting a different set of colors from the Color window.

Use the highlighted keys to start, stop pause, rewind and play again.  As the sequence plays, you can see the effects on the House Preview screen.

Select the Bars effect and drop it on the sequencer grid against the ‘Arches’ Model Group. Play the sequence and observe the effect in the Model Preview window and House Preview windows.
