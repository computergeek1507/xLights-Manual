# Model Definition

## **Model Definition**

In this section, we will define a Model, a Model Group and add the model to the Model Group.  Model and Model Group definitions are persistent, are to be defined once and can then be used in all your sequences.

As an example, I am creating an Arch model and will call it ‘Arch 1’. The arch is about 2.5 metres long and as such is made up of 25 RGB pixels.   

Click on the Layout tab, then click on the Arches icon. The selected icon will have a blue square around it.

Then click anywhere on the Canvas and drag slightly. An image of an arch will be displayed and an Arch model called ‘Arches-1’ \(the default name that is assigned to the model may be slightly different\) will be created with a default set of attribute values.

The start channel is 1. \(You can change this later\).  Change the Model name to ‘Arch1’ or ‘Arch 1’ or anything of your choice. Update the Nodes Per Arch value to 25. The end channel \(75\) will be calculated by xLights.  If you are adding a second model, ensure that the start and end channels do not overlap with other models.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can change the model name or any attribute by typing over/editing the attribute. For some attributes, click in the attribute window , to the right of the attribute name.
{% endhint %}

The Preview defaults to ‘default’ so that it will appear on the \(default\) House preview window.

Use the blue dots round the image to shrink it, rotate it if required and move it to the desired location. The green dot indicates the start of the model and the blue dot \(right bottom\) indicates the end of the model. When it is aligned horizontally, a red line is displayed between the green and blue dots.

The Arch1 image has now been moved to the bottom left location against the fence and has been reduced in size.  Click on the Save button \(just below the Models button\) to save the work that you have done so far. This includes the Model definition and its position on the Layout.
