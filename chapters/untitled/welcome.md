![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c2fai8-Giu1S9L1pjjE-GSFY1_kV12-9SPrXjnNc64VnC-pXsBq3ekAItPAUZhxUAhRl_9zlvuaUebdILDMeSIKLKtbrMK_GF6OYfgHS7kyUJweofBIU_MBAjeto_jTeWxBkfJ76)

In [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology) **Sisyphus** or **Sisyphos** \([/ˈsɪsɪfəs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek): Σίσυφος Sísuphos\) was the king of [Ephyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cichyrus) \(now known as [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth)\). He was punished for his self-aggrandizing craftiness and deceitfulness by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll down when it nears the top, repeating this action for eternity. Through the [classical influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism) on modern culture, tasks that are both [laborious](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/laborious#Adjective) and [futile](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/futile#Adjective) are therefore described as **Sisyphean** \([/ˌsɪsɪˈfiːən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)\).
