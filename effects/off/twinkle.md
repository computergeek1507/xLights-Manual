The Twinkle effect provides an effect of individual particles turning off and on slowly or rapidly, similar to the shimmer effect but with a different and more random implementation.  One or multiple colors can be used for the effect.

| Option/Settings | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Number Lights** | Defines and changes the number and pattern of the lights twinkling from a scattered pattern, to lights closely aligned, to an intense pattern. |
| **Twinkle Steps** | Controls the speed and accordingly the smoothness with which the colors of the lights change. |
| **Strobe** | If selected, will generate a strobe like effect to the twinkle. |
| **Re-Randomize after Tinkle** | When multiple colors are selected and option checked, the effect randomizes the colors displayed versus being in a defined order. |
