The DMX effect is used to output a value between 0-255 to the model.  Channel 1 in the DMX effect corresponds to the first channel of the model and up to 18 channels can be controlled.

Use a Single Line model for RGB nodes. As an example, 5 RGB nodes which will create 15 channels of data.

| **Option/Settings** | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Channels  1-10** | Select the tab to control Channels 1 -10 |
| **Channels 11-20**  | Select the tab to control Channels 11-20 |
| **Channels 21-30**  | Select the tab to control Channels 21-30 |
| **Channels 31-40**  | Select the tab to control Channels 31-40 |
| **DMX Value** | Select the DMX value \(from 0 to 255\) for the Channel that has been selected.  The channels will be offset from wherever is defined in the model definition.  So if the model for a DMX device starts at channel 450 then the channel 3 slot will control channel 452. |
|  | Click on the Value Curves icon to open a list of additional nonlinear effects.  Use the Ramp effect to vary the output anywhere from 0 to 255.   |

For Pan/Tilt head control movement, select the Use Ramps attribute and set it to a timing mark of say 10 seconds long. It will move the head for 10 seconds between the ramp values.
