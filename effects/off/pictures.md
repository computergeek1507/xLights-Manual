The Pictures effect is used to import a supported image type \(gif, bmp, jpg etc\) and render that image as an effect while also allowing the image to be manipulated and edited within xLights. You will need a image that is to be imported. Save the image as a GIF file and make the background color transparent if you don’t want the original \(white\) background of the image.

Place the Picture effect in on timing cells that you wish to have the effect on a model. Click on the effect on the grid and amend the parameters as required. First click on the Browse button and navigate to the location of your image, select the image and click open or double click to select the image.

{% hint style="success" %}
The playback rate is influenced by the length of the effect. So if you change the time length of your effect and have an image that is non stationary, the rate of movement will adjust according to the new time length.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you move the image that you have used for the picture effect to a different location or delete it, when you next run the sequencer, if the image is not found, an error message will not be displayed, but the picture effect will render a blank image. The only time this won’t happen is if only the drive letter has changed, and the rest of the path is the same.
