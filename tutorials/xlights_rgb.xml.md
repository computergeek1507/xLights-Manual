{% hint style="warning" %}

{% endhint %}

Most of the configuration data is stored in an xml file ‘xLights\_rgbeffcts.xml’ in your show directory. Occasionally, a corruption of a component of the file may occur and you will be asked to edit this file. This section describes the contents of this file and how to safely edit it . Before you edit the file, backup the file \(F10 from when in xLights will back up this and other xml files from your show directory\).

### Using Notepad++

One of the most useful free utilities is Notepad++. Download and install the latest version of Notepad ++ if you do not already have it installed.  The following description has been based on Notepad++ version 6.9 running on Windows. Depending on your version, the screen and options may be slightly different.  Once installed, install/activate the XML Tools Plugin.
